        <div class="overscroll-contain">Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the
            one that
            says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One
            whole
            hell of a lot.

            Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy, making the scene, flaunting
            convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library
            books?
            Well, let me give you a hint, junior.

            Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world,
            but
            what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding
            drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve
            better?</div>
