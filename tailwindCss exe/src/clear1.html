            we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a
            branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five

            books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind
