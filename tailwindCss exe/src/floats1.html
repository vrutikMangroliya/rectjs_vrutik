    <p>Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but
        what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding
        drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve
        better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is
        about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld;
        maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies.</p>
